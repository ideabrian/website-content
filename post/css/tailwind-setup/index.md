I recently set out to move my blog CSS to [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Tailwind is an interesting framework because instead of providing a set of widgets like Bootstrap or others, it provides *utilities*.

I find it resonates a lot with how I work with HTML.

I introduced how I use [Tailwind with Vue](/vue-tailwind/) in a previous post, but without a build tool in place already, it can be hard to get the correct setup right, and I decided to write this blog post even just for me to remember later on ðŸ™ƒ

In this post I explain how to use Tailwind with _any_ kind of project.

## Install Tailwind

First step is to install Tailwind, using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss
```

## Create the configuration file

Next, use the Tailwind command that is provided to create a configuration file.

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/tailwind init tailwind.js
```

This will create a tailwind.js file in the root of your project, adding the basic Tailwind configuration. The file is very long, and I wonâ€™t paste it here, but it contains lots of presets that will be very useful later.

## Configure PostCSS

Now you need to tweak the [PostCSS](/postcss/) configuration to make sure Tailwind runs. Add:

```bash
const tailwindcss = require('tailwindcss')

module.exports = {
  "plugins": [
    require('tailwindcss')('tailwind.js'),
    require('autoprefixer')(),
  ]
}
```

to your `postcss.config.js`. Create one if it does not exist.

## Create the Tailwind CSS file

Now create a CSS file where you want, like in  `src/tailwind.css` and add

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Create the build command

Now open your `package.json` file, and add a scripts section if you don't have it:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "build:css": "postcss src/tailwind.css -o static/dist/tailwind.css"
  }
```

## Build Tailwind

Now from the command line run `npm run build:css` will build the final CSS file.

The resulting file is in `static/dist/tailwind.css` (you can change the location in the above command).

## Trim the file size

If you check, the resulting file is huge. Even if you don't use any Tailwind class in your HTML, all of the framework is included by default, because that's the default configuration in the `tailwind.js` file.

They decided to include all, to avoid people missing things. It's a design choice. We now need to **remove stuff**, and it turns out we can use purgecss to remove all the unused CSS classes.

> Warning: I realized (Jan 2019) that this approach does not work when classes are escaped (like it happens for `w-1/2` for example or `mg:-mb-6` because / and : are escaped with a \ in the CSS), so pay attention if you use those special characters that need to be escaped.

I also want to remove all comments from the CSS and make it as small as possible. [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) is what we're looking for.

We can automate this stuff! First, install those utilities:

```bash
npm install cssnano
npm install @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss
```

Then we add this to our PostCSS configuration file `postcss.config.js`:

```js
const tailwindcss = require('tailwindcss')
const purgecss = require('@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss')
const cssnano = require('cssnano')
const autoprefixer = require('autoprefixer')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss('./tailwind.js'),
    cssnano({
      preset: 'default',
    }),
    purgecss({
      content: ['./layouts/**/*.html']
    }),
    autoprefixer
  ]
}
```

## Automatically regenerate the CSS upon file changes

In my case I have a folder called `layouts` which contains all the HTML files that build up my site.

It's the same folder I reference in the `purgecss` configuration above.

Every time I change something in there, I want to regenerate the CSS, and trigger the purge and minification I set up.

How to do this?

Install the [`watch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/watch) npm package:

```bash
npm install watch
```

and add the `watch` script to your `package.json` file. You already had `build:css` from before, we just add a script that watches the layouts folder and runs `build:css` upon every change:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build:css": "postcss src/tailwind.css -o static/dist/tailwind.css",
  "watch": "watch 'npm run build:css' ./layouts"
}
```

Now run `npm run watch` and you should be good to go!
